I was discussing the blog I was building with my family and the topic of blogging as a concept came up. My mother wanted to know why blog? For monetary reasons or something else? Here is what I responded with fairly off the cuff.

What I have loved about other's blogs is that they are documenting the issues they have run into and then sharing that information with the wider world. It makes it so that we can all benefit from their experience and their steps to solve a problem. Many people that write posts such as these claim they are writing for their future selves and if it benefits others, all the better. This goes along with an old open source ideal of a meritocracy. A meritocracy is defined as 

> government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability. 

Basically one advances their standing in a community because they have demonstrated an ability that is valuable.

Along the lines of a meritocracy being a good citizen of the internet is important. I feel that one of the greats things about the internet is dissemination of information and the best way to do so is via text. Text is excellent because it's easy to search, index and makes ideas and information easily accessible for all. Videos are maybe more entertaining or easier to consume but it's a bit harder to point to an idea right in a video or quote it. Having to watch a whole video to gather information is more of a commitment. Text on the other hand allows a reader to jump around and skim sections that are not interesting or not supportive of what they are looking for.

I have also wanted an area outside of work to share my interests in other technologies and experiments. Having somewhere to build something in public not only builds my ability to write and explain myself better but has the added benefit of demonstrating my general interest in the craft of programming. This will be essential to be able to asynchronously communicate
