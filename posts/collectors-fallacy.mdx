# Collector's Fallacy

Have you ever heard of a new concept and it described you or your behavior so well that it stopped you in your tracks? 
This recently happened to me and I wanted to tell you about the Collector's Fallacy.

To give some background, I am someone who is an information hoarder. I collect ebooks, articles, videos, browser tabs like toilet paper 
before a pandemic (too soon?). This saving of resources and even categorizing them with tags or organizing into lists if a form of wasted energy.
The material I've gathered for so long isn't actually making me smarter, it's a form of being in motion but not taking action.
If I were to use the material then I'd be in action, I'd be building software or making things in the garage or making videos or taking pictures. Instead
I allow it to collect dust and continue to search for new information that I won't use to actually ***do*** something with it.

So when I was watching a YouTube video by Shu Omi talking about this concept, it felt super uncomfortable because he was basically describing
me and my pattern of behavior.
